Trying to create own open-port tester, for use in so-called "Cyber-media, information Room" in ROKA.

Some might say I'm spamming incomplete repositories, but each repositories represents ultimate goal of what I am trying to achieve.

Without clear goal, it's impossible for me to learn what python provides, what limitation it has, and many more.

There will be 'Examples' Folders from now on to show things I'm struggling with - in case progress is way too slow.

Other repositories without it would have those in PyCharm Scratch folder, not in git.

Currently consecutive version of TCP port checker is working.  
To use it, don't forget to include `SharedData` folder with script!

Like this:
```
<SOMETHING> Verison
┠ <SOMETHING>_server.py
┠ <SOMETHING>_client.py
┗ SharedData
  ┠ config.json  << edit this.
  ┗ SharedModules.py
```
